# Palestinian Martyrs Data Structure Project

## Description

A robust data management system developed to organize and analyze martyr information sourced from B'Tselem, a trusted human rights organization in Palestine.
The project employs different data structures such as sorted circular doubly and single linked lists. The user interface is built using JavaFX with functionalities like
inserting/updating location records, searching for location records, managing martyr records, generating statistics, and saving data.

## Notice

All utilized data structures, including sorted doubly and single linked lists, are custom implementations developed by me, ensuring a tailored approach distinct from Java's built-in structures.

## Getting Started

To run this project, just download the project along the input file btselem.csv.
