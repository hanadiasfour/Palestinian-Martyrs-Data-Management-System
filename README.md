# Palestinian Martyrs Data Structure Project

## Description:
This project was created to organize and analyze Palestinian martyrs information sourced from ["B'Tselem"](https://www.btselem.org/).
The project uses many data structures like circular double and single linked lists. In addition, an interface was built using JavaFX to give functionalities like
inserting/updating location records, searching for location records, managing martyr records, generating statistics, and saving data.
