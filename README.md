# Palestinian Martyrs Data Structure Project

## Description

This project was created to organize and analyze Palestinian martyrs information sourced from ["B'Tselem"](https://www.btselem.org/).
The project uses many data structures like circular double and single linked lists. In addition, an interface was built using JavaFX to give functionalities like
inserting/updating location records, searching for location records, managing martyr records, generating statistics, and saving data.

## Notice

Any used data structures were custom implementations I developed to enhance my understandings.

## Getting Started

If you want to run this project, just download the project along the input file btselem.csv.
