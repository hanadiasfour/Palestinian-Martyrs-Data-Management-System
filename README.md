### Project3:
**The second version of the Palestinian Martyrs Data Management System.**
In this iteration, I've implemented advanced data structures—sorted doubly circular linked lists, AVL Trees, Queues, and Stacks—all built from scratch to deepen my understanding.

## What's New:

1. **AVL Trees & Sorting:**
   - Two AVL Trees organize Martyr records by name and DateStack objects by date.
   - Leveled traversal for Martyrs' full information in the 1st AVL tree.
   - Backward traversal in the 2nd AVL tree, displaying details from latest to earliest.

2. **Extended Statistics Screen:**
   - Height details for both 1st and 2nd AVL Trees offer structural insights.
